GUI: Rackspace Cloud Control Panel
----------------------------------
The Rackspace :mycloud:`Cloud Control Panel <>` is
the easiest way to start provisioning cloud resources.

The Cloud Control Panel provides a simple, unified, web-based
interface that works in all major browsers. After you sign up for a
Cloud account at :rax:`www.rackspace.com <>`, visit the Cloud Control
Panel to get an overview of the available products and services,
create your first servers and resources, and view information about
your Rackspace account.

To learn about how to use the Cloud Control Panel, start at the
:user-guide:`Rackspace Core Infrastructure User Guide <cloud-interfaces/gui>`.

For more information on using the Cloud Control Panel to interact
with a specific cloud service, see:

* :user-guide:`Cloud Block Storage and the Cloud Control Panel <cloud-interfaces/gui/cloudblockstorage-gui>`
