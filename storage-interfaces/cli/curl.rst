cURL CLI
^^^^^^^^
`cURL <http://curl.haxx.se/>`__ is a general-purpose
command-line tool for interacting with REST APIs. Using cURL to
submit a single request at the command line is a common
method of experimenting with an API before deciding whether to
write software to automate that request. The
:rax-docs:`Rackspace API documentation <>` includes many
cURL-based examples.

The following Rackspace publications provide basic information
about cURL:

* :rax-docs:`How cURL commands work <servers/api/v2/cn-gettingstarted/content/curl.html>`
* :kc-article:`Cloud Files cURL Cookbook <cloud-files-curl-cookbook>`
* :rax-docs:`Authenticate with cURL <servers/api/v2/cs-gettingstarted/content/curl_auth.html>`

In the :rax-dev:`Developer Center <docs/>`, you can see examples
of using cURL to send requests to the API endpoints for many
Rackspace cloud services. Select a service, and then click
**SHELL** as your preferred language to see samples
formatted for use at the command line with cURL.

You can use any tool that enables you to type a command, send it
as a request to a REST API's endpoint, and then examine the
API's response.
