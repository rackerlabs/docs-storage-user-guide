Software Development Kits
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Software development kits (SDKs) provide easy to use, language-specific
interfaces for accessing and integrating APIs into your applications
and workflows. Often these libraries also abstract the
functionality required to support your applications and workloads
across multiple cloud endpoints or providers.

Rackspace supports SDKs for the following languages:

* Go
* Java
* .Net
* Node.js
* PHP
* Python
* Ruby

You can find links to all the Rackspace-support SDKs, with
installation instructions, guidance, tutorials, and more for each,
in the :rax-dev:`Rackspace Developer Center <>`.
