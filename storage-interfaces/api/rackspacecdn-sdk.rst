Learn about Rackspace CDN in SDK QuickStart
-------------------------------------------
In the :rax-dev:`SDK QuickStart for Rackspace CDN <docs/cdn/getting-started>`,
you can see some of the same steps that are documented in the
API's getting started guide. For example, both the API-focused
and SDK-focused documents show how to authenticate with your API
key before issuing any requests to the Rackspace CDN API.

The SDK QuickStart adds examples in several popular programming
languages, demonstrating how to use each language to code some
commonly-used requests to the Rackspace CDN API.

To see examples in a specific language, click that language's
name in the list across the top of the page. For example,
to see Rackspace CDN code samples in PHP, go to the
:rax-dev:`SDK QuickStart for Rackspace CDN <docs/cdn/getting-started>`
and click *PHP*.
