Learn about Rackspace CDN in API documentation
----------------------------------------------
In the :rax-api:`API cross-reference<>`, you can see all
available API operations for all cloud services. The
operations are grouped according to the service they
interact with (for example, Cloud Files or Rackspace CDN) and
the scope they act on (for example, containers or services).

You can see all Rackspace CDN operations in the
:rax-api:`API cross-reference <api-ref-raxCDN.html>`. In
the group of
:rax-api:`operations that act on services <api-ref-raxCDN.html#raxcdn_ServicesOperations>`,
you can see that:

* Sending a ``POST`` request to the ``v1.0/{project_id}/services``
  URI requests creation of a new service

* Sending a ``GET`` request to the ``v1.0/{project_id}/services`` URI
  requests a basic list of all services
