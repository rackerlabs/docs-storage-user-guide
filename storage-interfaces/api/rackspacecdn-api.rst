Rackspace CDN and SDKs and APIs
-------------------------------
When you begin writing your own software to interact with
Rackspace CDN, you might want to learn how Rackspace CDN works
in the Cloud Control Panel and how SDKs and APIs
are documented at Rackspace.

Using an API, you can write software to automate functions that
could otherwise be performed manually by a person logged
in to the Cloud Control Panel. You can accelerate your
understanding of how the API works by using the Cloud Control
Panel to demonstrate the manual process before you
begin to automate it; to interact with the
Rackspace CDN service, the Cloud Control Panel sends
requests via the same API that you interact with when you
write your own software.

Sometimes, especially for new features that are not yet
available in the Cloud Control Panel, you can write software
to perform functions using the API that could not be
performed in any other way. Product announcements for
Limited Availability and Early Access releases point out this
limitation when it applies. In that case, experimenting
in the Cloud Control Panel can show you only part of the process
of working with a new feature; other details are described
in the :rax-docs:`API documentation <>`.

Just as you can use the Cloud Control Panel to help you
understand a manual process that you intend to automate, you
can use the API documentation to help you understand
how to use a software development kit (SDK) in your
favorite programming language.

* The API documentation describes *what* you can ask the API to do.

* The SDK documentation demonstrates *how* to ask the API to do something.

Awareness of both API and SDK capabilities can help you to plan the
easiest way to develop your software.
