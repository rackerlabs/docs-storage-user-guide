Direct API access
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Each of our cloud services exposes and API that can be leveraged
for low-level integration with the service.
Rackspace APIs, like OpenStack APIs, are
Representational State Transfer (REST) APIs, meaning that
they are logically structured, stateless, and scalable
(among other properties).

For most use cases, we recommend working with the guidance
of an SDK rather than integrating directly with an API.
In the :rax-dev:`Developer Center <>`, basic functions
for many APIs in many popular programming languages are
documented in quickstart guides. However, knowing the API
structure and being able to make direct, manual calls so the API is
a powerful tool for understanding and managing the Rackspace
cloud infrastructure.
