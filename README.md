Rackspace Cloud Storage Services User Guide

Storage services include:

* Cloud Files
* Cloud Block Storage
* Rackspace CDN
* Cloud Backup

This repo is a place to collect ideas for future document development. 
When the Storage Services User Guide exists, it'll resemble the Core Infrastructure User Guide at https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/user-guides/infrastructure/.
