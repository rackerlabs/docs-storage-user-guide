Understanding Rackspace CDN
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Rackspace CDN includes a RESTful API with a single
global endpoint, and the ability to cache
publicly accessible resources hosted on a Cloud Server instance,
or a public Cloud Files container.

Rackspace CDN is powered by the Akamai Technologies content
delivery network, one of the world's largest distributed computing
platforms, and employs a
custom map of over 200 edge nodes across six continents:
* 77 North American locations
* 36 European locations
* 73 Asian, Middle Easter, and Oceania locations
* 15 South American locations

For a full list of Rackspace CDN features, see
:kc-article:`Features of Rackspace CDN <features-of-rackspace-cdn>`.

Rackspace CDN provides a simple API and Control Panel experience
for you to manage your CDN-enabled domains and the origins
and assets associated with those domains.
