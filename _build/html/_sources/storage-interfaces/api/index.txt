API and SDK: Developer and DevOps tools
---------------------------------------
If you write applications that are tightly integrated with
the Rackspace cloud, you might find that clicking to
choose options in the Cloud Control Panel and typing to
issue commands with CLIs are not ideal for your purposes.

If you develop or distribute applications for your customers,
or if you wish to heavily automate operation of your
cloud infrastructure, you might need to interact with
cloud services through one of the many available
software development kits (SDKs) or by direct API access.

If you are responsible for administering systems that are
used for cloud software development, you might want to
investigate DevOps tools designed for this purpose.

To learn about how to use SDKs and APIs, start at the
:user-guide:`Rackspace Core Infrastructure User Guide <cloud-interfaces/api>`.

For more information on using SDKs and APIs to interact
with a specific cloud service, see:

* :user-guide:`Cloud Block Storage and SDKs and APIs <cloud-interfaces/api/cloudblockstorage-api>`
* :user-guide:`Cloud Files and SDKs and APIs <cloud-interfaces/api/cloudfiles-api>`
