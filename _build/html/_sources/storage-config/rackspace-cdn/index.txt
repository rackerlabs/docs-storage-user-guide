==================================
Rackspace Content Delivery Network
==================================
A content delivery network (CDN) is designed to improve the
performance of delivering your content to your
audience around the world. Your content can be anything--website
files, applications, audio and video files, ads, or
interactive experiences.

When your audience or customers request your content, they
get it from their nearest edge node, or local server,
instead of where you originally uploaded it, reducing the
travel time of your content.

Rackspace CDN includes a RESTful API with a single
global endpoint, and the ability to cache
publicly accessible resources hosted on a Cloud Server instance,
or a public Cloud Files container.

Rackspace CDN is powered by the Akamai Technologies content
delivery network, one of the world's largest distributed computing
platforms, and employs a
custom map of over 200 edge nodes across six continents:
* 77 North American locations
* 36 European locations
* 73 Asian, Middle Easter, and Oceania locations
* 15 South American locations

For a full list of Rackspace CDN features, see
:kc-article:`Features of Rackspace CDN <features-of-rackspace-cdn>`.

Rackspace CDN provides a simple API and Control Panel experience
for you to manage your CDN-enabled domains and the origins
and assets associated with those domains.

To learn how to use the Cloud Control Panel and the API to
interact with Rackspace CDN, begin at the following resources:
