Rackspace Content Delivery Network
----------------------------------
A content delivery network (CDN) is designed to improve the
performance of delivering your content to your
audience around the world. Your content can be anything--website
files, applications, audio and video files, ads, or
interactive experiences.

When your audience or customers request your content, they
get it from their nearest edge node, or local server,
instead of where you originally uploaded it, reducing the
travel time of your content.
